ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ *Hi*, I'm Subhan Raj, a student of CSE at **Lucknow, India**.

## Why I'm using GitHub ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”

*Well I have **many** reasons for that-* 

* I can view, edit and publish my projects from anywhere 
* I have a passion to promote and use open sourse software and resources, and GitHub is the home of that.
* I don't have any fear of loosing my work, as it's on cluod, so I can acess it from anywhere.
* If I want to tell some one and showcase my work, I can publish it throung GitHub pags

_**Now I think that it provides a brief intro, why all my scrappy work is online**
